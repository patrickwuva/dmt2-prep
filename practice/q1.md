# Quiz 1 Review

### 1. True False [8 points]
T/F A $Computer$ is simply any mechanism that transforms $strings$ into other $strings$

T/F All $Computers$ must have access to $memory$

T/F There are an infinite number of unique $Python programs$, but they do not cover / implement all possible functions

T/F $\left| \{0,1\}^\infty \right| > \left|{ℕ}\right|$

T/F If $\left|S\right| < \left|ℕ\right|$, then $\left|S\right|$ is countable

T/F $f(n \in ℕ) = n + 1$ is a surjective function

T/F Every subset of $\left|ℕ\right|$ is countable

T/F The diagonalization proofs we have seen are examples of _proof by contradiction_

### 2. For each claim and proof below, select whether the proof is valid or whether it has an error. For each item, the claim is true, so  there is always some valid proof. [2 points each]

**Claim:** $∀ n > 2, n % 2 = 0$, there exists a 3-regular (each node has degree 3) graph with $n$ nodes

**Proof:** Let $G$ have $n$ nodes 0 to $n$ - 1. Add the edges ${i, i + 1}|0≤i≤n - 2$, the edge ${n - 1, 0}$ and the edges ${i, i + \frac{n}{2}|0≤i≤\frac{n}{2} - 1}$

**Claim:** There are $2^n$ binary strings of length $n$

**Proof:** for length, 1 there are $2^1 = 2$ strings (0 and 1). Suppose there are $2^k$ strings of length $k$, to each of those we can add a 0 or a 1 to increase length by 1. Thus there are $2^k + 2^k = 2(2^k) = 2^k+1$ strings of length $k + 1$
