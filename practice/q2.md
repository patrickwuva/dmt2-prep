# Quiz 2 Review

## Part 1.
Answer the following True / False questions

(T/F) A finite language is always recognizable by a $DFA$

(T/F) $DFAs$ and $NFAs$ recognize the exact same set of languages

(T/F) A $DFA$ accepts if it ever enters an accept state

(T/F) An $NFA$ only accepts if all branches reach an accept state

(T/F) An $NFA$ can be in an infinite number of states at once

(T/F) Regular languages are closed under complement (i.e., the set of all strings NOT in the original language)

(T/F) All $NFAs$ can be converted into a _regular expression_ that describles the same language

(T/F) $0^n1^n$ is not a valid _regular expression_

## Part 2.
1. Give a regualr expression for (or describle in words) the language that this $DFA$ recognizes

2. Convert the following $NFA$ into an equivalent $DFA$ using the construction we saw in class. Specifically, the $DFA$ should have states representing subsets of states in the $NFA$ wiht appropriate transitions.

## Part 3.
These questions are about using the pumping lemma to prove that the language $A = {0^i1^j2^k|i + j = k}$ is no ta _regualr language_

1. First, list a string that cannot be pumped (just list it, you will get credit even if you do not know why it cannot be pumped)
2. Now, describe precisely why the string cannot be pumped. Makesure to include all possible cases if applicable
